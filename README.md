# Starfieldviewer
Visualization of starfield data from Aurora4x, with apparent brightness based on Sol system.<br>

You need to extract two tables from Aurora4x - https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php:
- DIM_KnownSystems.csv
- DIM_StellarType.csv
I have deleted the black hole data at the end of DIM_StellarType. <br>

Pan/tilt camera with mouse while holding right mouse button.<br>
Move forward in x,y plane with 'W', backwards with 'S'.<br>
Unfortunately can not move forward in z axis at the moment.<br>
